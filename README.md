# CatAdopt Demo

This is a demo repo used to show how you can use Code Connect in concert with a
design to be able to quickly bring new designs to life. The demo starts at
commit `dc66d95e47211ae84d0efa9d2a61c8997d0aaa09` and is completed after I
add the Dialog component and wire it up in commit `dc66d95e47211ae84d0efa9d2a61c8997d0aaa09`.
